How to write a hydro code, in Rust!

## Intro
This project is intended to help students learn how to write fast, pedagogical hydrodynamics codes for use in astrophysics modeling. I have decided to write these tutorials in Rust for a number of reasons:

1. For my own enjoyment, I wanted to learn Rust!
2. Rust is easier to learn than C++ and it yields safer code; no more seg-faults for new programmers!
3. Because of Cargo and the Rust ecosystem: just write your physics solver in Rust and harvest the rest of your app from the hive
